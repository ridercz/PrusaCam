# PrusaCam USB

This is smartphone camera controller that emulates USB keyboard. It's intended for any board that uses **ATmega32u4**, ie. Arduino Leonardo, Pro Micro etc. The [HID Project](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID) library is used to emulate the USB keyboard.

To use it with your cellphone, you need a way to connect your board to your phone. Common solution is "USB OTG adaptor", which will convert the MicroUSB or USB-C port of your phone to common USB type A connector. Then you'll use standard MicroUSB cable to connect the board.

I'm actively developing this project now, documentation coming soon.
